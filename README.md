## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this project.
2. Work inside of the `build_arrays.js` file. Inside that file you will see your objectives as comments.
3. use `nodemon` to help your work flow. e.g. `nodemon build_arrays.js`

Once you are done, commit and push your work,  
then, merge this branch into your `master` branch. then push that branch.  
This completes the exercise.
